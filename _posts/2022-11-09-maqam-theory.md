title: An Overview of Arabic <em>Maqam</em> Theory
description: This system that defines Arabic music is called maqam (مقام pl. <em>maqamat</em> مقامات), meaning “place” or “position” and it is, at surface level, similar to the Western musical scale. However, maqam is an all-encompassing term for not only the pitch collection but the tonicization, melodic development, modulation possibilities, phrasing, and even historical conventions.

Music in the Western world is largely built upon a theoretical framework based on twelve-tone equal temperament; an overall pitch collection of twelve notes divided equally within the octave. Such a limited selection of notes affords musicians wide possibilities in the realm of harmony, it allows us to contextualize such harmonic and melodic possibilities in a way that is widely understood, studied, and applied. It is that same limited selection of notes that has dominated and continues to dominate the musical tradition worldwide for its ease of use, ease of enjoyment, and popularity. 

It can be hard for us to imagine music outside of this framework: music lacking in harmony and clear-cut melodic developments, music that challenges us to listen deeper. Yet, this is where music as a whole began and where it continues at limited capacity throughout the Eastern world. One such example is Arabic music, which has its own vast framework built upon rich history and tradition.

It is an intuitive framework within their culture that has been passed down orally for centuries. The meticulous quality of the music–the microtonality and emphasis on intonation in performance coupled with the attentiveness with which it must be listened–makes it nearly impossible to accurately describe it theoretically through writing.

### What is *maqam*?

This system that defines Arabic music is called maqam (مقام pl. *maqamat* مقامات), meaning “place” or “position” and it is, at surface level, similar to the Western musical scale. However, maqam is an all-encompassing term for not only the pitch collection but the tonicization, melodic development, modulation possibilities, phrasing, and even historical conventions.

A maqam will compose of two to three scale fragments called *ajnas* (أجناس sing. *jins* جنس) chained together where the first begins the maqam scale with its tonic, and the next is connected by the ghammaz (غماز) of the first. The ghammaz is the modulation point of a *jins*, where subsequent *jins* connect, and it is usually the top note. These scale fragments are made up of three to five notes.

Depicted is Maqam ‘Ajam, consisting of *jins* ‘Ajam as the root *jins* and *jins* Upper ‘Ajam as the upper *jins*, with the tonic numbered 1 and *jins* ‘Ajam’s ghammaz numbered 5.

*maqamat* are organized in families depending on their root *jins*. The principal maqam in any given family usually shares its name with its root *jins*. The rest are designated ‘branch *maqamat*’ because the root *jins* can be proceeded in many different ways, like branches.

Despite the pitches above being notated in twelve-tone fashion, in practice the intonation is quite specific and impractical to write. Interestingly, intonation in maqam differs from region to region such that a well-versed listener could distinguish where an ‘ud player is from by the subtle differences in how they play a given maqam.

Intonation becomes an even denser subject when you consider that different *ajnas* that share notes in common will still have slightly different intonations for those particular notes. *jins* Hijaz and *jins* Nahawand share a D, Eb, and G, yet will still require a slight shift in sounding those notes in order to play with the correct intonation.

The difference that such a small change can make in the sound and feeling of a maqam is vast, and Arabic musicians take advantage of this by using modulation.

### Modulation

Before understanding modulation, it is important to understand that full scales are very rare in Arabic music. In fact, as opposed to Western theory, the scale is not even a fundamental component of Arabic music. Rather, a maqam melody typically spans one *jins* for some time before moving to the next. However, you wouldn’t want to remain in one maqam with the same two *ajnas* for the entire piece.

“Composing or improvising a piece in one maqam without any modulations is like painting using different shades of a single color.” (Farraj 333)

The main sign of a modulation in maqam is a shift in tonicization, meaning a different note will feel like the ground, like home. There are many different types of modulation, and these types fall into two broad categories: *jins*-*jins* and maqam-maqam.

Traditionally, all modulations were only maqam-maqam, but in more recent times this has been deemed incongruent with real practice. The most common type of modulation is *jins*-*jins*, the distinction between the two will be discussed later on.

A maqam is not only its root and upper *ajnas*, but also all of the conventional upper *jins* modulations. The most common and distinct form of modulation is a change of upper *jins*. For example, Maqam ‘Ajam (shown previously) in its most basic form uses *jins* Upper ‘Ajam as its upper *jins*. However, it is also common for *jins* Nahawand or *jins* Hijaz to take its place. This does not change the overall maqam, but it is a *jins*-*jins* modulation. It is the simplest type of *jins*-*jins* modulation; interval alteration. It is easiest to execute between two *ajnas* that have the same tonic and ghammaz because only the inner notes must be altered for the modulation to occur. A subtype of interval alteration is the “mid-*jins* switch” in which part of a melody is played in one *jins* before switching to another *jins* with the same tonic and ghammaz in the middle of the phrase.

Another type of *jins*-*jins* modulation is through switching tonics. This is usually done by switching from the original *jins*’ tonic to its ghammaz. However, there are cases where an upper *jins* is not connected by the root *jins*’ ghammaz, and instead overlaps the middle of the root *jins*. Here, it is possible to modulate from the original tonic to the root note of the overlapping *jins*.

Now, we move to the much rarer (except in long songs) maqam-maqam modulations. What sets these apart from a simple upper *jins* modulation is that the entire pathway of typical modulations, called sayr (سير), is changed and the new one explored. *jins* ‘Ajam with upper *jins* Hijaz is called Maqam Shawq Afza, but simply modulating from *jins* Upper ‘Ajam to *jins* Hijaz does not constitute a modulation from Maqam ‘Ajam to Maqam Shawq Afza. It is that pathway, the sayr, that must follow in order for this to be heard as a maqam-maqam modulation. In most cases, that upper *jins* Hijaz will simply find its way back to *jins* Upper ‘Ajam or *jins* Nahawand, and we will not have modulated whatsoever. However, if we were to see some characteristic developments of Maqam Shawq Afza, such as *jins* Saba Dalanshin (which would not be a characteristic development of Maqam ‘Ajam), then it would be considered a maqam-maqam modulation.

A helpful analogy from Farraj is that of a bus driver. The musician is a skilled bus driver who knows many streets, including back alleys and shortcuts. The main street would be the basic maqam, but the bus driver may want to take you on a more interesting and exciting journey by taking you through the side streets and alleys. These would be the various upper *jins*. It is not so easy, because you must eventually find your way back to the main street. This is *jins*-*jins* modulation. Once you venture to a new main street, you have an entirely new set of alleys and paths to take. This would be a new maqam. Think of this music as a vast network with countless interconnections. As the bus driver, you can take your passengers on a different journey every single time, and with enough experience you may be able to venture very far out and explore before finding your way back to the main street.

Semitonal *maqamat* and their Western Equivalents

One of my own projects was to analyze the rough intervals of ‘semitonal’ *maqamat*–where the intervals are only made up of semitones and not quarter tones–and to compare them to Western scales and modes. The document can be found at this link: https://bit.ly/3huWE9T

In practice, when Arabic music is being performed with piano or other instruments with limited accuracy in intonation, it is generally played with semitonal *maqamat* and adjusted accordingly to match the intonation of the piano.

### Summary

*Maqamat* are built from chained scale fragments called *ajnas*, and are sorted into families based on their root *jins*. Intonation is extremely important and can be the deciding factor of authenticity to the region. Each maqam has its own characteristic sayr(s), or typical pathway of modulations. Modulations may occur between *jins* or between maqam, although the latter is much rarer. Sometimes, compromises in intonation are made to allow for more limited instruments to join the ensemble, and this is easier to execute with semitonal *maqamat*.

Even today, maqam is not very widely accessible for students or listeners, and as such there are few sources on the topic. This is in part due to the primarily oral transmission of the idiom over the centuries. The historical conventions of maqam, which include sayr-s, canonical modulations, and even specific phrases, are still upheld today and slowly but surely continue to be expanded by young and innovative musicians in the Arabic music scene.
