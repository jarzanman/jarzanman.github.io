I'm not quite a Berklee student, but I've taken many a class there in the past few years as part of their Aspire and High School Academy programs. Throughout all of my theory classes, I've found that harmonic analysis is one of the toughest topics for people to understand. It is a nearly all-encompassing topic, but this article aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to harmonic analysis in the Berklee method.

Before taking this up, you should know all of the basic chord qualities and how to build them within scales.

## Roman Numerals

Where does a chord get its Roman numeral designation from? First, we have to understand scale degrees and diatonic chords. Notes that naturally occur in a given scale are diatonic to that scale. Each note in a scale can be labeled with a number that indicates the note’s scale degree, starting from the first note in the scale and ascending. For example, D is diatonic to C major, and being the second note in the scale, it's scale degree 2.

Now, if we build a chord using a diatonic root note and diatonic chord tones, we get a diatonic chord. Individual notes are labeled with Arabic numerals, i.e. scale degrees, but chords are labeled with Roman numerals. A chord’s Roman numeral is determined by the scale degree of its root note. So, a G minor triad in the key of E♭ major is the III- chord.

<div class="important"><div><p>In most systems of Roman numeral analysis, minor chords are designated with lowercase Roman numerals, e.g., G minor in E&#9837; major would be the iii chord.</p><p>At Berklee, all Roman numerals are uppercase and a chord's quality is indicated by some other symbol. More on that later.</p></div></div>

Notice that the Roman numeral designation of a chord says nothing about its pitch or the key that it’s in. This means that a diatonic chord built on the 3rd scale degree of a major scale is III- regardless of the key. This allows for easy transposition of chord progressions. Want to play IVmaj7 in A? Go up to the fourth scale degree and play a major 7th chord: Dmaj7.

With all of this information we can lay out every diatonic chord in a major scale and label each one. If the chord qualities confuse you, you should probably go brush up on that.

Ta-da! That's Roman numerals.
