I'm not quite a Berklee student, but I've taken many a class there in the past few years as part of their Aspire and High School Academy programs. Throughout all of my theory classes, I've found that harmonic analysis is one of the toughest topics for people to understand. It is a nearly all-encompassing topic, but this article aims to serve as a comprehensive guide to harmonic analysis in the Berklee method.

Before taking this up, you should know all of the basic chord qualities and how to build them within scales.

<p class="question">Can you spell the seventh chord built on D&#9837; in the key of A&#9837; major?</p>

## Roman Numerals

First, lets look at a scale. Each note in the scale can be assigned a number, or "scale degree," starting from the tonic.

A note that belongs in its scale is *diatonic*. This definition applies to chords as well. If you build a chord using only diatonic notes, you get a diatonic chord.
