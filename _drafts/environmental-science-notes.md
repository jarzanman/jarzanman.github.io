<span class="dc">I</span> thought I would knock out two birds with one stone and do some long-form article format testing while also studying for AP Environmental Science. My teacher's videos aren't very comprehensive, so I'm working mostly off of Withgott's Environment textbook.
## Plate Tectonics
There are three types of plate boundaries.

At a **transform plate boundary**, two plates slip and grind alongside each other. The friction caused by this leads to earthquakes.

A **divergent plate boundary** is where two plates move apart from each other, opening up a rift through which magma rises to the surface. As the magma cools, it forms new lithosphere.

**Convergent plate boundaries** are most complex, as they can give rise to different outcomes depending on the plates involved. At this boundary, two tectonic plates collide at the lithosphere and the denser plate dives down into the asthenosphere in a process called **subduction**. As this plate sinks, it is heated and pressurized, melting rock that may erupt through volcanoes at the surface.

When two oceanic plates converge, the resulting volcanic activity can form island arcs like Japan. When an oceanic plate and a continental plate converge, volcanic mountain ranges form along the coastline. Finally, when two continental plates converge, both resist subduction and instead crush, bend, and deform each other. These deformed masses of crust are forced upwards, thus creating mountain ranges.
