<p>I’m something of a nomad when it comes to world music, jumping from region to region and collecting souvenirs along the way. The landscape of Asian Electronica sticks out to me distinctly because it feels as if I’m in nature. I wanted to explore the reasons for this, and I did so by focusing on one sub-region: Japan.</p>
<h2 id="kankyō-ongaku-and-the-history-of-field-recordings"><em>Kankyō Ongaku</em> and the history of field recordings</h2>

<p>One of the most prominent features of contemporary Japanese electronica is found sound, or field recordings. This is a common technique in which one would record audio in their area and manipulate that audio recording to achieve a desired sound during production. Japanese found sounds are very distinct, built upon over a century of ambient music innovations and many centuries of Japan’s unique sounds of the environment and the tradition; what Hiroshi Yoshimura calls “public sound art.” In order to understand the uprising of this technique in Japanese music, we must look back to 1917…</p>

<p>Erik Satie might have been the first ambient musician in the world, having coined the term <em>musique d’ameublement</em> or furniture music to describe his compositions. These compositions were designed to be ignorable and to blend in with the environment; background music. This concept was quite polarizing, but some people found it to be a beautiful idea and took it into their own hands.</p>

<p>American musician John Cage was one such person. Having been so inspired by Satie’s works, he revitalized and popularized them. He continued to create similar works with his unique philosophical perspective, much of which is influenced by Japan’s Zen Buddhism. Cage’s most famous work, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWVUp12XPpU">4’33</a>,” is four minutes and thirty-three seconds of nothing. The purpose is to listen to the environment of the concert hall–people coughing, breathing, shuffling–the ambience.</p>

<p>In the early 40s, French composer Pierre Schaeffer and his colleagues were given the opportunity to experiment with recording technology, and he developed a tape manipulation technique that he applied to primarily field recordings. This technique came to be known as <em>musique concrète</em>, and it was the first instance of field recordings being developed into musical compositions. An important early example is his “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpOD7GQbd8Q"><em>Symphonie pour un homme seul</em></a>.”</p>

<p>This technique found its way to Tokyo, where in 1951 an avant-garde artist collective called <em>Jikken Kōbō</em> was formed. A member of the collective, Tōru Takemitsu was heavily influenced by <em>musique concrète</em> and John Cage. He experimented with unconventional musical structures and tape manipulation, creating his own relatively popular <em>musique concrète</em> pieces. Composer Toshiro Mayuzumi, however, beat the collective to it in 1953, creating the first ever Japanese instance of <em>musique concrète</em> titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U88TWCYzeto">X, Y, Z</a>.”</p>

<p>In the mid-70s, British composer Brian Eno finally coined the term “ambient music.” Inspired by Erik Satie, John Cage, Pierre Schaeffer, and the quiet harp music playing over the rain by his hospital bed, he created his first ambient work in 1975 titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl_z5JvrKlc">Discreet Music</a>.” In the liner notes of the album, he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eno gained a following in Japan when his records were first imported to a record shop named Art Vivant, founded by ambient musician Satoshi Ashikawa. His work, along with Erik Satie’s, birthed <em>Kankyō Ongaku</em>, or Environmental Music. It was Japan’s form of ambient music that heavily incorporated field recordings. Hiroshi Yoshimura, a pioneer of the genre, says that much of the music is informed by historical sound-design traditions such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jV-I_F0P5khttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jV-I_F0P5k"><em>suikinkutsu</em></a> (water zither) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpyryxShwgg"><em>toki no kane</em></a> (Bell of Time). A modern example of this might be the melodic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuMfyndwARQ">Westminster chimes</a> used in Japanese schools. Yoshimura’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-k9Xu5O7AYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-k9Xu5O7AY">GREEN</a>” is perhaps the most popular and influential <em>Kankyō Ongaku</em> album today.</p>

<p>Japan is rich with these sorts of environmental sounds, it is their culture, and that’s why their found sounds are so distinct. That culture is infused into their music. Especially in modern developments that have spread West–such as the group <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqiPPuCN4-8">Fuubutsushi</a>–you can hear Japanese folk music traditions seeping through. Many contemporary Japanese musicians cite different environmental soundscapes that bring inspiration to their music; those of Japanese gardens or the bustling and bright Tokyo streets or the mighty force of the earthquakes that plague the country so often. The landscape of Japan is a defining aspect of their music, despite how unrelated it may seem.</p>

<h2 id="the-american-occupation-and-economic-miracle">The American occupation and economic miracle</h2>

<p>From 1898 to 1948, the Philippines were an American colony. Right in the middle of this period of colonization, many Filipino musicians had the opportunity to study abroad in America, where they learned jazz and brought it home. Around the same time, there was a massive increase of luxury ocean liners going across the pacific. These ocean liners would have orchestras performing on board, and many of the orchestra musicians were Filipino and Japanese. When arriving on the West Coast of the US, they would all go to music stores to buy sheet music and records.</p>

<p>This allowed jazz to find its way to Japan, where it became widespread in hotel lobbies and dance halls, although the music was quite commercial and undeveloped; songs and solos were short to sell more tickets. This was happening while massive American record companies Columbia and Victor were selling jazz records in Japan, further spreading the jazz influence.</p>

<p>Following the Empire of Japan’s surrender in 1945, the United States mobilized to occupy Japan and administer its military and economy. Hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were stationed across the island, and a large-scale recovery effort of the war-torn country would proceed. These soldiers wanted entertainment; they wanted jazz music. Many of them were musicians as well, but there were not enough of them to form big bands or jazz orchestras. To remedy this, they would go out and hire Japanese musicians to play jazz arrangements. There was widespread unemployment at the time, so musicians were lucky to be able to get these gigs, making the operation hugely successful.</p>

<p>There were enough jazz seeds in Japan to cultivate great young musicians, notably <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sutvim58cIQ">Toshiko Akiyoshi</a>. She discovered jazz in 1945 from a local record shop and fell in love. Legendary pianist Oscar Peterson heard her playing in a club while on tour in 1952, and convinced a record producer to record her. She went on to become the first Japanese student at Berklee College of Music. With figures like Toshiko Akiyoshi and Sadao Watanabe, jazz was becoming huge in Japan.</p>

<p>The American occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and what followed was an explosion of economic growth and technological advancement. The Ikeda administration installed a policy of heavy and rapid industrialization and began vast exportation. A new class of Japanese citizens were reaping the benefits of this economic boom. People were able to afford American luxuries like champagne, and the city streets were booming with activity.</p>

<p>Not only did this stimulate boisterous soundscapes that inspired musicians at the time to explore genres like City Pop, but it also saw Japanese manufacturers jumping into musical hardware. They could afford the materials, they had the means, and they could anticipate demand, so they began selling instruments, and later on, synthesizers.</p>

<p>Synthesizers had already existed in the Western world at ridiculous price points, and similar versions existed in Japan as well. This economic miracle, however, finally allowed manufacturers to innovate and produce the world’s first affordable synthesizers. They were high quality and informed by Western music and the excitement around pop music in Japan. Companies like Korg, Yamaha, Roland, and Audio-Technica were innovating drum machines, turntables, home stereo units, mixers, synthesizers, and more. Soon enough, Japan essentially had a monopoly on electronic music production tools.</p>

<p>Since WWII, American music has been assimilating into Japanese culture and influencing countless musical explorations within the country. This was catalyzed by Japan’s economic miracle following the American occupation, which resulted in many innovative technologies and musical production hardware. From here, contemporary Japanese electronic music really began taking shape, especially with the help of perhaps the single most important pioneering figure: Haruomi Hosono.</p>

<h2 id="haruomi-hosono-and-yellow-magic-orchestra">Haruomi Hosono and Yellow Magic Orchestra</h2>

<p>Grandson of the sole Japanese passenger and survivor of the Titanic, Haruomi Hosono was born in Tokyo in 1947 and grew up listening to FEN, the radio station serving the U.S. military during their time in Japan. All of the music he listened to was in English, and a lot of it was from California in particular. At the time, there was a psychedelic music movement happening on the West Coast, and this would be his first major influence in his style and career. In an interview by Red Bull Music Academy, Hosono says, “I was thoroughly Americanized, I even regretted that I wasn’t American.”</p>

<p>Among his other early influences were Western comedies, namely Charlie Chaplin and Jacques Tati, and Taishō-era poetry. Hosono mentioned listening to Martin Denny as a kid, and specifically taking inspiration from the animal calls and singing birds used throughout his music. He would take all of these influences with him and infuse them into his music as he grew up to be the legendary multi-instrumentalist renowned in Japan and around the rest of the world that he is today.</p>

<p>Hosono was in several groups throughout his career, the first being Apryl Fool in the 60s, a psychedelic rock band in which he played bass. His second group was one of the most influential: Happy End. Happy End is widely credited as the first Japanese band to sing in Japanese. Up until then, all Western-inspired music was sung in English, and nobody thought to try otherwise. Hosono says that he learned about the importance of cultural roots in the creation process from all of the American musicians he listened to. Realizing that Apryl Fool and early-Happy End were disconnected from their Japanese roots, he felt that he needed to implement his culture to add originality and meaning to his music. He had no idea about any traditional Japanese instruments though, all he knew was words. Thus, they sang in Japanese, and this was a massive game-changer.</p>

<p>Happy End is also thought to have created the first instance of City Pop: their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVR1ALVqGxA">self-titled album</a>. Their lyrics often spoke about cosmopolitan Tokyo and what life was like in the bustling post-war city. After Happy End dissolved, each of the members went on to advance City Pop with their own separate careers.</p>

<p>Following Happy End’s breakup, Hosono put out a few solo works. For his fourth solo album, he recruited the help of a few musicians including Ryuichi Sakamoto on keys and Yukihiro Takahashi on drums. Hosono played bass, steelpan, marimba, percussion, synthesizer, guitar, sang, and produced the album. It was called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvL8RA8-ks8">Paraiso</a>,” released under “Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band.” The album was heavily inspired by jazz, Hawaiian and Okinawan exotica, and tropical island life overall. They also used new Japanese synthesizers, including the ARP Odyssey and Yamaha CS-80. He and the two previously mentioned would go on to form the electronic music group Yellow Magic Orchestra, or YMO.</p>

<p>Before touching on YMO, it is important to note that Ryuichi Sakamoto was an important pioneer of electronic music in Japan in his own right. He released his debut solo album titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGo7n6CMCcE">Thousand Knives</a>” only a month before YMO’s debut. It featured many of the top synthesizers of the day, and was inspired by the hard-bop of Herbie Hancock, reggae, and psychedelia. It incorporated a cacophony of found sounds as well.</p>

<p>Yellow Magic Orchestra was conceptually influenced by German techno band Kraftwerk. Sakamoto says that YMO saw the focused and distilled themes in Kraftwerk’s music and thought it was “very German.” They knew they had to make their music inherently Japanese, and with that in mind they tried to embody the chaos of Japanese culture and society in their music.</p>

<p>They accomplish that often through the use of field recordings and sampling. On the first song, “Computer Game” of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYh_43Wr9aU">debut self-titled album</a>, they incorporate sounds from arcade video games they enjoyed playing at the time, such as Space Invaders. The second song “Firecracker” is a cover of Martin Denny’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKaBP2zckAY">Firecracker</a> and samples much of it. Firecracker became wildly popular in particular, being sampled by Afrika Bambaataa, Jennifer Lopez, and Mariah Carey.</p>

<p>The group had a unique opportunity to use ridiculously expensive synthesizers, such as the Roland MC-8 (US$4795 at the time). A notable use of such technology is on their 1981 album “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i7J7sBVzeI">BGM,</a>” which was the first time the Roland TR-808 had ever been used in a release. The TR-808 is responsible for the booming bass drums (called 808s) in rap music today, and they were first discovered here. Pitchfork describes the album as the culmination of each of the YMO members’ sounds and careers. It notably features Hosono’s exploration of <em>Kankyō Ongaku</em> on the track “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNWyA40pwRs">Loom,</a>” and the album title itself references a common name for Japanese ambient music, BGM for Background Music. Two tracks on the album reference, in their titles, Hosono’s previous group Happy End and Sakamoto’s 1000 Knives. The album was wildly influential in hip-hop, pop, and electronic music all around the world.</p>

<p>Hosono produced a solo ambient work later on titled “Watering a Flower.” It was commissioned by the Japanese retail company MUJI to use as background music for their stores. Speaking of commercial music, YMO produced a song called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02IvYUAJbtY">Behind the Mask</a>” in 1978 for a Seiko quartz wrist-watch commercial. Later on, they had English lyrics added and released the song on their album “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmed0gmwzKY">Solid State Survivor</a>.” This was one of their most internationally successful songs yet, and it was sampled by none other than Michael Jackson.</p>

<p>Hosono also worked as a session musician, producer, arranger, and composer for several artists in the Japanese scene, such as Akiko Yano, a major pop and jazz singer, Yuma Abe, a fun contemporary electronic musician, Cornelius, another innovative electronic musician, and Miharu Koshi, a singer with whom he collaborated on an electronic lounge album titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06HcFuiHWZ4">Swing Slow</a>.”</p>

<p>Hosono’s huge catalog spans so many different genres, many of which he helped to inspire and innovate, such as City Pop, Shibuya-kei, Japanese-language rock, and more. Yellow Magic Orchestra, Haruomi Hosono, and all of their influences leave a huge footprint on today’s electronic music, in Japan and East Asia.</p>

<h2 id="examples-and-conclusion">Examples and conclusion</h2>

<p>Each of these landmark figures, events, and movements in the history of Japanese music provide some valuable insight into the soundscapes of contemporary East Asian electronic music. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH0y2GRiHjI">Rei Harakami</a> is one example of an artist who was influenced by all of these things. You can hear the jazz and ambient influences as well as the field recordings used in his records, which are all produced on a Roland SC-88.</p>

<p>One of my favorites, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HNrH-LV0hc">Mid-Air Thief</a>, is a South Korean producer who incorporates a wide plethora of found sounds in his music. He’s also an instrumentalist versed in jazz, and it comes through in his music. A similar artist in this respect is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOHlAmHpemI&amp;">Ohzora Kimishima</a>.</p>

<p>On the more ambient side is Haruka Nakamura, whose solo piano album “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISjlRcBsTs">Still Life</a>” seems to take heavy stylistic inspiration from Ryuichi Sakamoto’s calming solo piano works. Enchanting singer Ichiko Aoba is in this same ambient vein, and her piece “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6afKjSpax5g">Mars 2027</a>” incorporates heavy pink noise and gives off a <em>musique concrète</em> impression.</p>

<p>These are only a few examples, but these influences can be prominently heard throughout the music of countless musicians in the East. To break it down into a few things, it was field recordings, ambient music, jazz, Japanese hardware, and a plethora of influential musicians helped evolve Asian electronic music to where it is now. It’s clear that America heavily influenced it in many aspects, but it is important to note that none of it could exist without the ever-present Japanese culture; the Bell of Time and natural sounds, the traditional instrumentation, the historical art and poetry, the pride in their own country, the optimism during the economic boom, and even their Buddhist and Shintoist philosophies. That patriotism was evident with Happy End singing in Japanese, and with YMO turning Kraftwerk into something entirely Japanese. Japan was never copying anyone, they took all of these external influences in and output something inherently Japanese.</p>
