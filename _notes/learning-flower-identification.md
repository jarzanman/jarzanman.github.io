Lately I've been diving into botany for fun, and I made my first confident plant identifications just yesterday: *Helianthus tuberosus*, *Symphyotrichum cordifolium*, and *Silene latifolia*. It's really exciting to finally have certainty in what I was observing, and the thought that I might be able to recognize these flowers in the future, as if they're new friends, is even more exciting.

But before I was able to make those identifications, there was a lot I had to learn in the way of taking the right photos, using a dichotomous key, and navigating confusing terminology. So I've decided to write about what I've learned to solidify my knowledge, and mayhaps this could serve as a guide to someone out there.

## Taking the right photos
You probably don't carry a Flora around, so you'll need to take a lot of pictures of the plant you're trying to identify. I didn't know what to take pictures of for some time, so I'd end up back at home looking through Flora Novae Angliae with no recollection of whether the leaves were opposite or alternating. The key to taking the right photos is knowing what to look for: the stuff that will be on your dichotomous key.

1. <p>You'll need a photo of the face of the flower. Specifically, you need to be able to see the <strong>androecium, gynoecium, and petals</strong>. If the flower is imperfect, try to get pictures of the separate carpellate and staminate flowers.</p>
2. <p>Get a photo of the underside of the flower. This will give you a good view of the <strong>calyx or involucral bracts</strong>. You'll also be able to tell if the supporting stem is pubescent, scabrous, glaucous, and so on. It's okay if you don't know what any of those terms mean yet, but having the photo will help you learn once you sit down with a key.</p>
3. <p>Take one of the <strong>inflorescence</strong>. If there are multiple flowers on one plant, you're looking at an inflorescence. The term describes the arrangement of flowers on the plant, and with this photo you'll be able to determine if you're looking at an umbel or a corymb or a raceme. Again, don't worry about the terminology for now.</p>
4. <p><strong>Leaves</strong>. The petioles, leaf structure, arrangement, venation, and shape will help narrow things down.</p>
5. <p>Finally, take a photo of the <strong>entire plant</strong>. With this you'll be able to see the distribution of leaves along the stem, and you can always zoom in to catch any details that were missing from the other images.</p>

This isn't going to work all of the time, but it's a good minimum to run with. It should get you through most identifications. Whenever I'm really unsure, I'll upload a photo to iNaturalist or Google's image search and look for a genus. If you do this, I suggest working backwards from that genus in the dichotomous key to learn about its features. This way, you'll be able to identify it without relying on such tools.
