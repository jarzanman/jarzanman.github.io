I should not like to think that some demigod had come before me and picked out some of the best of the stars. I wish to know an entire heaven and an entire earth.

<p>Here's my site. It's still in an early phase of construction, but its been fun learning HTML and CSS to make this thing.</p>
<p>This'll contain my photography, writing, hopefully music at some point, and other miscellaneous things. I'll be writing about lots of topics, from botany to chess to competition maths to music theory to aesthetics to book reviews and so on. I've just got to actually start writing all of that stuff. One day.</p>
<p>Basically, this is all just filler text for now.</p>
