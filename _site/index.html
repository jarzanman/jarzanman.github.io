 <h2 style="text-align: center">welcome to my website</h2>
<p>
  Round the world and home again<br />
  That's the sailor's way<br />
  Faster faster, faster faster
</p>
<p>
  There's no earthly way of knowing<br />
  Which direction we are going<br />
  There's no knowing where we're rowing<br />
  Or which way the river's flowing
</p>
<p>
  Is it raining, is it snowing<br />
  Is a hurricane a–blowing
</p>
<p>
  Not a speck of light is showing<br />
  So the danger must be growing<br />
  Are the fires of Hell a–glowing<br />
  Is the grisly reaper mowing
</p>
<p>
  Yes, the danger must be growing<br />
  For the rowers keep on rowing<br />
  And they're certainly not showing<br />
  Any signs that they are slowing.
